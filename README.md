## Writing about my project in at least five bullet points


ANS - 


    * As an admin you can hire an employee who is not hired yet by
    purchasing a specific package for member limit and then you can also
    make a team with certain employees. To make this I used Stripe.js for
    payment, React, MongoDB for database, in backend node.js and
    express.js
    
    * An admin can see the custom request list of employees and all
    requests just so you know you can add an asset too. As an employee
    you can make custom requests and see your team. To make this I
    used React, MongoDB for database, in backend node.js and
    express.js
    
    * To make things interesting we have birthday options for employees
    on the team page and all types of requests are shown in the admin
    home and employee home page which is Informative
